The rapid growth of cloud computing is revolutionizing the information technology industry. In
simple terms, cloud computing offers seamless delivery of in-demand computing services including,
but not limited to, servers, storage, databases, networking and software over the internet. The
unimpeded rise of cloud computing platforms brings forth a new set of security challenges that
need to be addressed on a priority basis. Cloud computing technologies force the introduction of
new and innovative security techniques which are drastically different from the ones being used in
traditional computing systems. As a result, cloud security is at the forefront of modern-day
research.
Through this project, we aim to gain a deeper practical understanding of cloud computing security
by launching a virtual network-based attack using OpenStack, a widely popular open-source cloud
computing infrastructure software project.<be><br>The implementation of this project can be broadly
categorized into three major phases:<br>
i. Installation & Configuration of OpenStack Infrastructure and Required Computing Resources<br>
ii. Network Attack Simulation<br>
iii. Detection & Evasion of Attack Using Snort<br>
